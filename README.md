# flask-try

A repositoriy using for recording flask studying, with Bootstrap for front-end and SQLite for database.

Having deployed using uWSGI+Nginx, but have little know about their config files. :(

## What I have realized

* a simple login/logout/register module(without fliter).
* a model manage module only applied for one model.
* blueprint
* connected with flask-admin

## Todo List

* register fliter (both front-end and back-end)
* the short link module
* connected with Elastic Stack?
* user right setting --> submit&confirm module

# Nothing for flax

A repositoriy using for recording flask studying, with Bootstrap for front-end and SQLite for database.

Having deployed using uWSGI+Nginx, but have little know about their config files. :(

## What have been realized

* a simple login/logout/register module(without fliter).
* a model manage module only applied for one model.
* blueprint
* connected with flask-admin
* login-required and admin-required wraps
* back-end register fliter
* bad ajax(for further restful api development)

## Todo List

* the short link module
* connected with Elastic Stack?
* submit&confirm module
